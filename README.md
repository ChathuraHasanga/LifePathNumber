# Life Path Number Calculator (Java)

This is a simple Java application that calculates a **Life Path Number** based on the digits of your birth date.  
The program asks you to enter **eight single digits** (representing the digits of your date of birth), validates each input, and then reduces the total sum into a single digit (your Life Path Number).
